# Hidden_Markov_Model

In this project, I implemented hidden Markov models in order to recognize spoken digits. This was MP4 of 
ECE 417 at UIUC. More details can be found on https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece417/fa2021/mp/mp4_notebook.html.

The file "submitted.py" contains all the solution code for each prompt in the notebook.
